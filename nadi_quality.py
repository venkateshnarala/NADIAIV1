Outlier detection (IQR method + Grubbs-Beck test per USGS Bulletin 17B/17C)
and change-point detection (Pettitt test + CUSUM), all applied to the
ANNUAL MAXIMUM SERIES (AMS) rather than the raw daily series, which is
standard practice in flood-frequency analysis (the daily series is
non-stationary within a year by design - seasonality - so change-point /
outlier tests are only meaningful on the annual extremes).

All functions take a 1-D numpy array / pandas Series of annual maxima and
return plain dictionaries of results so they can be dropped straight into
report tables.

        "the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) to define the "
        "spread of the central 50% of the data, making it a simple and "
        "robust technique that does not require any assumption about the "
        "underlying probability distribution."
    ),
    "purpose": (
        "The test computes the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR = Q3 - Q1) and "
        "establishes the lower and upper fences as Q1 - 1.5 x IQR and "
        "Q3 + 1.5 x IQR, respectively. Observations falling outside these "
        "limits are flagged as potential outliers. The analysis uses the "
        "standard Tukey multiplier (k = 1.5), which provides a widely "
        "accepted balance between identifying unusual observations and "
        "retaining genuine extreme flood events. Although the method is "
        "robust and assumption-free, its performance can be influenced by "
        "small sample sizes, where quartile estimates may be less stable."
